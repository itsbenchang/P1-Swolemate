            <strong>Daniel</strong> is an fighting enthusiast that belives swoleness is achieved through heart and grit.  He is the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour. He with the biggest arms and and the greatest charm, he is the women's bet and the man's regret. What you see is what you get, and what you don't is better yet. It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog. We here are Swolemates seek to cultivate that in each person </p>

            <strong>Charlotte</strong> is an avid traveler, exploring all aspects of life. Some legends speak of a traveler that has wandered the world leaving nothing but destruction in her wake. Many names have been whispered throughout the ages but only one name persists: "Anon". Is she that wanderer? Who is to say? 
            What we do know is that she believes "to travel is to live" and exploring new ideas, people, and places is paramount to the growth of a person both mentally and physically. She forms the cornerstone of Swolemates: namely People, Places, and Passions </p>

            <strong>Ben</strong> a former Biggest Loser contestant (citation needed) needs no other laurels to qualify him as an expert of all culinary things. He understands that good food is not only the primary source of health and fitness, but also building relationships between people. As such, he is concerned with providing a intuitive and roboust chat interface to facilitate communication between potential swolemates. </p>
